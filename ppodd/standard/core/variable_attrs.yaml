VariableAttrs:
    long_name: 
        required: true
        description: >-
            A long descriptive name of the variable.
        inherits_from: null  # NUG? It's specified by unidata...

    standard_name:
        required: false
        description: >-
            A standard name from the list of CF (Climate and Forecast) standard names vocabulary
        inherits_from: CF16
        alaises: []
        versions: [1.0]

    units:
        required: true
        description: >-
            The physical units of the variable, which should be interpretable by the UDUNITS
            library. If the variable has a standard_name, then the units must be equivalent
            to the canonical units of that standard_name. If the variable has no physical units,
            then the units attribute takes the value 1.

    _FillValue:
        required: true
        description: >-
            Technically the _FillValue attribute is the value used to pre-fill disk space assigned
            to a variable. Practically, _FillValue is used to indicate missing data. The default
            _FillValue for core data is -9999, however this can, if required, be set on a
            variable-by-variable basis.
        inherits_from: null  # Again NUG? Unidata? Essentially integral to the API
        default: -9999

    coordinates:
        required: false
        description: >-
            Auxillary coordinates for variables are variables which contain coordinate data,
            but which are not themselves coordinate variables (FAAM core data do not
            include any non-temporal coordinate variables). When the coordinates attribute
            is given, it should be a blank separated string naming the longitute, latitude and
            altitude of (one of) the aircraft GPS solution(s). It is not required by the standard
            to allow for the unlikely case where there is no GPS solution available.

    frequency:
        required: true
        description: >-
            The frequency of the variable after processing, in Hz. In a 'full' resolution file,
            the frequency will correspond to the numeric part of the second dimension, e.g. a
            variable with a frequency of 32 will have sps32 as a second dimension. In a fixed
            resolution file, the frequency will always correspond to the fixed frequency.

    sensor_serial_number:
        required: false
        description: >-
            The serial number of the sensor responsible for making this measurement. A sensor is
            a single, calibratable unit.

    sensor_type:
        required: false
        description: >-
            The type of the sensor responsible for making a measurement, where more than one type
            of sensor may make the same measurement. A canonical example of this is for temperature
            sensors, which may be of type 'plate', 'loom', or 'thermistor'.

    instrument_serial_number:

        description: >-
            The serial number of the instrument responsible for making a measurement. Use in
            preference to sensor_serial when the instrument is not a simple sensor.

    ancillary_variables:
        required: false
        description: >-
            When one data variable provides metadata about the individual values of another data
            variable it may be desirable to express this association by providing a link between
            the variables. All non flag variables should have at least one ancillary variable, 
            that of their flag, which should be named <variable_name>_FLAG.

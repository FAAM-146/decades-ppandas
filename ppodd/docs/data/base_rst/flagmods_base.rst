Flagging Modules
================

Flagging modules run after the main processing jobs are complete, and provide further flagging
information to variables. This may be required where the input information cannot be guaranteed
to exist due to variations in the aircraft fit. Therefore, the flags provided by these
standalone flagging modules may or may not be present in the data.
